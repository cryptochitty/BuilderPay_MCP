# 🚀 BuilderPay

**BuilderPay** is a next-generation Web3 platform designed to **empower builders** by connecting them directly with donors who want to support impactful projects — *no scores, badges, or gatekeepers needed*.  

On BuilderPay, anyone can donate Celo or cUSD directly to builders they believe in, while builders can optionally **earn passive income** through ad revenue sharing. By integrating **Self.ID**, builders create self-sovereign, verifiable identities they control — building trust with donors and maintaining ownership of their digital reputation.

BuilderPay’s goal is to provide a **transparent, decentralized funding model** that gives builders sustainable income streams and rewards genuine community support.

## ✨ Features

Builders use decentralized identities (DIDs) through [Self.ID](https://self.id/) for secure, portable, self-sovereign profiles.

Builders can opt-in to show ads on their profiles. Monthly ad revenue is tracked and distributed automatically via smart contracts.

- Builders sign in with MetaMask or WalletConnect to create/retrieve their DID.

- Donors can verify builder profiles before donating, increasing trust and transparency.
